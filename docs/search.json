This is a comprehensive, annual, national database. Austin Cory Bart is the individual who pulled public data from CCD and created the dataset that was published on October 24, 2016. The dataset consists of information on over 575 students’ average GPA per subject, SAT and subject test scores, state of residency, and family income, per year. There is a concern that this data can create misguided conclusions and perpetuate stereotypes and misconceptions based on academic scores and socioeconomic status.\n\n\nHow does average household income affect US students’ development in each school subject between the years of 2005 and 2015?\n\n\nIt is important to know how financial status is affecting students and the new generation. The country can then take steps to work towards improving education for all if there is a problem found. Economic status should not negatively impact children and their ability to get a proper education and succeed in the world. Education is very important as it creates not only a better society with well informed citizens, but also allows for students to later get better paying jobs and create a strong workforce.\n\n\n\nThe research will use the average math and verbal scores of students per year who reported that their family income was in certain income brackets. Those income brackets range from less than 20k, 20-40k, 40-60k, 60-80k, 80-100k, and more than 100k. A negative or positive correlation can then be analyzed. The variables are average math score, average verbal scores, and family income bracket. The average math and verbal scores are quantitative variables. The family income bracket is a categorical variable. If state and year are also later analyzed, they are also both categorical variables. We are including a new categorical variable of “region” based on states to control this variable.\n\n\n\nThe hypothesis is that students with a household income below the median of 60k will have lower math and verbal scores on average than their counterparts with family incomes higher than 60k. This may be because they likely have more resources to strengthen their academic skills such as private tutoring, a stress-free home environment, and parents who have achieved higher education; however, we cannot confirm that there is a causal relationship from this data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRows: 577 Columns: 99\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr  (2): State.Code, State.Name\ndbl (97): Year, Total.Math, Total.Test-takers, Total.Verbal, Academic Subjec...\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\n\n\nHere, we select variables from the data associated with our research question.

    "text": "Literature Review\nDespite education being viewed as an equalizer in society, many studies in recent years have highlighted a widening education gap depending on affluence and household income. While the educational gap based on race has shrunk since the 60s, imbalance in college completion and test scores has grown by 40% since the 60s.(Reardon 2018) There are many factors that contribute to this increasing gap in education including differences in resources, time, and other high-stress variables.\nOur research question builds on the article’s focus on the recent discovery that income levels affect education. Rather than focusing on college completion or overall test scores, we will focus on specific school subjects and how they differ based on income levels."

    "text": "Methodology\n\nLonger Pivot\nFigure 1: Barchart of State by Income with Type of Test and Region\n\n\n\n\n\nWe used a barchart due to the variables we were analyzing and the relationships we wanted to assess. For a barchart, we could facet into different regions, compare the categorical variable of income with the quantitative variable of average score, and furthermore differentiate between verbal and math scores using “fill”. Our new variable, Region.Name, allowed us to facet this - we created this variable above with each state in their respective region and joined it with our dataset.\n\n\nFigure 2: Ridgeline of Score vs Income\n\n\nPicking joint bandwidth of 7.47\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Ridgeline of Score vs Income with Type of Test\n\n\nPicking joint bandwidth of 8.55\n\n\n\n\n\nWe chose to use a ridgeline model because it’s easy to interpret the different distributions of scores per income category. We can also see general trends in frequency and range of scores through the ridgeline model. It is easier to see the highest frequency (highest peak) of scores per income level than if we had used a boxplot.\n\n\nFigure 4: Linear Regression of Income and Region on Score\n\n\n# A tibble: 9 × 5\n  term                 estimate std.error statistic   p.value\n  &lt;chr&gt;                   &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 (Intercept)             498.       1.50     332.  0        \n2 Income20k.to.40k         41.4      1.72      24.1 6.13e-123\n3 Income40k.to.60k         63.2      1.72      36.8 1.61e-269\n4 Income60k.to.80k         73.7      1.72      42.9 0        \n5 Income80k.to.100k        84.8      1.72      49.3 0        \n6 Income100k+             102.       1.72      59.5 0        \n7 Region.NameNortheast    -57.3      1.54     -37.1 4.61e-274\n8 Region.NameSouth        -42.3      1.34     -31.6 1.17e-203\n9 Region.NameWest         -37.9      1.40     -27.0 2.04e-152\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Linear Regression Equation\n\\[\n\\widehat{score} = 497.91 + 41.4*Income.20k.to.40k + 63.22*Income.40k.to.60k \\\\ + 73.72*Income.60k.to.80k + 84.77*Income.80k.to.100k \\\\ + 102.21*Income.+100k - 57.33*Northeast  \\\\\n- 42.3*South - 37.86*West\n\\]\n\n\nAnalysis of Figures 1-4\nUpon analyzing the first visualization there appears to be a positive correlation between household income and national math and verbal scores of elementary and secondary students. This graph uses a combination of both math and verbal scores to show a general trend between academics and household income, regardless of subject. Using the density ridges plot, allows the graph to show the frequency of each test score. The students with a household income of 20k showed the highest frequency of test scores at about 425 while students with a household income of 100k+ had the highest frequency of test scores at about 550. This visualization showed a positive linear correlation between the two variables.\nThe second visualization was created to allow distinction between regions and the test academic subjects, therefore introducing region as a new variable. This graph provides more insight into if geographic location affects the relationship between average test scores and household income. The results showed that the South and Northeast showed a more positive linear correlation between the two variables, while the North Central and West regions showed more variability yet a slight positive correlation as well.\n\n\nJustification for Regression Model Selection and Analysis of Linear Regression Equation\nWe decided to use the additive linear regression model rather than the interactive linear regression model because we wanted to be able to isolate the relationship of family income on score versus region on score. Additionally, a linear model is used when a response variable is quantitative (which ours is), while logistic is used when a response variable is categorical. If we hold region constant, a student with a family income of 20-40k can expect an on average 41 point increase in score above the baseline, which is the on average score of a student with a family income of less than 20k. Students with a family income of 40-60k can expect a 63 point increase on average above the less than 20k students. This trend of higher scores on average continues as family income increases. Keeping income constant, students from the Northeast region score 57 less points on average than students from the Northcentral region (baseline region). South region students score 42 points less on average than Northcentral students, and West students score 38 points less on average than Northcentral students.\nThe pattern of an increase in score coinciding with an increase in family income lends significance to our hypothesis that family income affects students’ scores, specifically that students with a higher family income on average score higher. The regions finding appear to have a significance, but we do not know enough about regional education relationships to interpret this significance. The linear regression clearly points to the Northcentral students as the highest scorers on average, with West students on average scoring the second highest, South as the third lowest on average, and North east as the overall lowest on average.\n\n\nAIC Analysis of Potential Regression Models\n\n\nparsnip model object\n\n\nCall:\nstats::lm(formula = Score ~ 1, data = data)\n\nCoefficients:\n(Intercept)  \n      525.1  \n\n\n\n\n              type_of_test      aic\n1              Control AIC 71547.95\n2             Basic Linear 68720.25\n3    Additive Type of Test 68717.52\n4          Additive Region 67264.20\n5 Interactive Type of Test 68723.34\n6       Interactive Region 67182.58\n7         Interactive Both 67208.83\n8            Additive Both 67260.30\n\n\n\n\nJustification for Choice of AIC Over R Squared\nWe decided to use AIC, a measure of likelihood (how well a model fits the data), rather than R squared because AIC penalizes the addition of new predictors while R^2 rewards (sometimes artificially) the addition of new variables, no matter how related to the topic those variables are. Since we have worked with models that artificially inflate R squared scores when more variables are added and we knew we wanted to add additional variables to the model, we decided to veer away from the R squared model and try AIC. Because the equation to determine AIC has a negative before the log likelihood, lower AIC values are indicative of better model fits. Based on our forward selection analysis, the best model fit is an interactive model using the explanatory variables of region and score and exclusing the variable of type of test. Because adding type of test as an additional variable in our linear models leaves us with a higher AIC, ultimately we’ve decided not to create different graphs isolating reading or math scores.\n\n\nHypothesis Test\n\nData for Hypothesis\n\n\nRows: 6,576\nColumns: 6\nGroups: versus_median [2]\n$ state          &lt;chr&gt; \"Alabama\", \"Alabama\", \"Alabama\", \"Alabama\", \"Alabama\", …\n$ Region.Name    &lt;chr&gt; \"South\", \"South\", \"South\", \"South\", \"South\", \"South\", \"…\n$ `Type of Test` &lt;chr&gt; \"average.math.score\", \"average.verbal.score\", \"average.…\n$ Income         &lt;fct&gt; 20k.to.40k, 20k.to.40k, 40k.to.60k, 40k.to.60k, 60k.to.…\n$ Score          &lt;dbl&gt; 513, 527, 539, 551, 550, 564, 566, 577, 588, 590, 462, …\n$ versus_median  &lt;chr&gt; \"Less\", \"Less\", \"Less\", \"Less\", \"Greater\", \"Greater\", \"…\n\n\n\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`.

Since it is (and the p-value is significantly small), we can then reject the null hypothesis.\nDecision: With a very small p-value, we reject the null hypothesis that the true mean score for students with family incomes less than 60k is equal to the true mean score for students with family incomes greater than 60k.\nConclusion: We have strong evidence to conclude that the true mean score for students with family incomes less than 60k is not equal to the true mean score for students with family incomes greater than 60k."

    "section": "Results",
    "text": "Results\nOverall, these two visualizations and the linear regression model as well as our hypothesis test and significantly small p-value support the idea that average household income affects a student’s development in school.\nThe visual outputs from our two visualizations align with the output from out additive linear regression model. For example: for region, the facet of Northcentral has higher scores in the bar graph while Northcentral on average has the highest scores in the linear regression model. There was a clear positive trend between family income and score in our ridgeline model which was reflected in the positive trend between higher scores on average and an increase in family income in the linear regression model.\nAs the average household income increased so did the average verbal and math scores, regardless of region. There appears to be a significance in the pattern of data that falls in line with our hypothesis since both visualizations and our model showed that students with a household income below the median of 60k had on average lower math and verbal scores than families above the median. These students are more likely to have socioeconomic factors that impact their development in school. However, it can be assessed as to how generalizeable this data can be for the public as there was no information provided as to how this data was collected, it can not be confirmed if random sampling was used.\n\nDiscussion\nWe can reject the null hypothesis that the true mean of scores of students that come from lower income households (less than 60k) is equal to the true mean of scores of students that come from higher income households (greater than 60k). Furthermore, based on our figures including a bar chart and two ridgeline graphs, we have observed a trend towards a higher score when a student has a higher family income. Finally, it appears as though region has an impact on the strength of correlation between income and score, but that must be further exained. Our hypothesis test led us to fail to reject the null hypothesis, which corroborated our hypothesis and the observations we made of our visualizations and additive linear regression model.\nBecause education and testing is impacted by a variety of different factors that we were unable to control for, including variables like quality of school district, teacher skill, level of parental involvement, we are unable to determine a causal relationship between income and score. Additionally, we are assuming that the data is accurate and collected bias-free, which is something we cannot verify without a conversation with the scholars who collected the Department of Education Data.\nWe hope to build upon this research in the future in two ways: first, by controlling more variables to create a more accurate model and second, by exploring the relationship between region and score to a greater extent. We did not run a hypothesis test for the potential of a difference in score based on region or specifically one income level to another which could be a potential area for further research.\nWe could potentially control the additional variables that impact education by creating another dataset with more information about students, including their level of parental involvement in their education and the funding of their school."

    "text": "Our project primarily assessed the impact of a child’s family’s income on verbal and math scores on a federal exam administered to primary and secondary aged students. We secondarily included the variable of “region” to provided a basis for further research. Based on visualizations, a hypothesis test, and a linear regression, there appears to be an observable significance that points towards a higher income level correlating to a higher score. Both visualizations and our model showed that students with a household income below the median of 60k had on average lower math and verbal scores than families above the median which provided strong evidence for the rejection of the null hypothesis and the potential veracity of our provided hypothesis. We cannot determine a direct causation between income level and score, however, it can not be assessed as to how generalization this data can be for academic development of a student overall since this data covered only one federally administered test and relevant factors like parental involvement and school funding was not included in the data set nor our model. Further research into the impact of region on score is recommended due to preliminary findings in our visualizations."

    "text": "Introduction and data\nThis data comes from the Common Core of Data (CCD), which is the Department of Education’s primary database on public elementary and secondary education in the US. This is a comprehensive, annual, national database. Austin Cory Bart is the individual who pulled public data from CCD and created the dataset that was published on October 24, 2016. The dataset consists of information on over 575 students’ average GPA per subject, SAT and subject test scores, state of residency, and family income, per year. There is a concern that this data can create misguided conclusions and perpetuate stereotypes and misconceptions based on academic scores and socioeconomic status."

    "text": "Research question\nHow does average household income affect a student’s development in each school subject throughout the United States, between the years of 2005 and 2015?\nIt is important to know how financial status is affecting students and the new generation. The country can then take steps to work towards improving education for all if there is a problem found. Economic status should not negatively impact children and their ability to get a proper education and succeed in the world. Education is very important as it creates not only a better society with well informed citizens, but also allows for students to later get better paying jobs and create a strong workforce.\nThe research will use the average math and verbal scores of students per year who reported that their family income was in certain income brackets. Those income brackets range from less than 20k, 20-40k, 40-60k, 60-80k, 80-100k, and more than 100k. A negative or positive correlation can then be analyzed. The variables are average math score, average verbal scores, and family income bracket. The average math and verbal scores are quantitative variables. The family income bracket is a categorical variable. If state and year are also later analyzed, they are also both categorical variables.\nThe hypothesis is that if students have a low family income of 60k or below, their average math and verbal scores will be lower than students who have a family income of higher than 60k, due to the fact they likely have more resources to strengthen their academic skills such as going to better academic institutions."

While the educational gap based on race has shrunk since the 60s, imbalance in college completion and test scores has grown by 40% since the 60s. There are many factors that contribute to this increasing gap in education including differences in resources, time, and other high-stress variables.\n\nIn 1-2 sentences, explain how your research question builds on / is different than the article you have cited.\n\nOur research question builds on the article’s focus on the recent discovery that income levels affect education.

However, one per data set is required.)\n\nOver the years, have crime rates (property and violent) increased more in certain regions of the country?\n\nStatement on why this question is important.\n\nThis question is important as it allows rates to be investigated and certain patterns of crimes throughout the country. In visualizing these patterns, areas where more crime occurs can be identified and actions can be put into place to prevent crime.\n\nA description of the research topic along with a concise statement of your hypotheses on this topic.\n\nThis research topic focuses specifically on crime rates (rather than totals) to account for population growth in the country. I hypothesize that crime rates will have increased more in the southern region of the country, as this region typically has higher crime rates, especially for violent crimes.\n\nIdentify the types of variables in your research question. Categorical? Quantitative?\n\nIn the research question, year is a categorical numerical variable. Crime rate is a dependent quantitative variable. Region of the country is an independent categorical variable."

This paper furthers this research by determining how crime rates change depending on the structure of geographical areas, using the three categorizations of rural areas, urban areas, and standard metropolitan statistical areas. The ultimate conclusion is that crime is a social phenomena and that the relationship between crime rate and structure of geographical area depends on the type of crime being measured.\n\nIn 1-2 sentences, explain how your research question builds on / is different than the article you have cited.\n\nThough this article observes the general trends of property and violent crimes across different geographical structures, it does not study any specific cities.

    "text": "Introduction and data\n\nIdentify the source of the data.\nThe data was initially pulled from Forbes World’s Billionaires list from 1996 to 2014. Researchers at the Peterson Institute for International Economics expanded on this research by adding multiple variables to the data set. \nState when and how it was originally collected (by the original data curator, not necessarily how you found the data).\nTo curate their annual list of global billionaires, Forbes assigns a specific team to create an exhaustive list. This team conducts online research (such as analyzing SEC and other government documents, news articles, and general records), interviews candidates and their teams when possible, and consults financial experts to better estimate fortune value. Forbes began publishing this research in 1987, but our dataset begins with the year 1996. Thus, they likely began research for this dataset in the mid 1990’s. For the additional variables, Peterson Institute researchers obtained information through both Forbes’ numerous biographies, news articles, and other websites, and internet and LexisNexis searches.  \nWrite a brief description of the observations.\n The dataset contains over 2000 observations on billionaires, covering multiple characteristics for each fortune holder. Demographic information such as name, age, gender, citizenship, and home country are listed, as well as information about the billionaire’s company.  Wealth-related data is broken up into the variables “wealth.worth in billions” (which identifies net worth), “wealth.how.industry” (which industry this wealth was accumulated through), “wealth.how.inherited” (if this wealth was inherited and from whom), and other similar variables. Data is organized by rank, with the “1” spot indicating the highest aggregate wealth. Rank is taken from separate annual lists so that wealth is compared in the context of the year it was earned. \nAddress ethical concerns about the data, if any.\nThough the dataset addresses inherited data, it does not make note of other factors that could explain why it is much easier for certain demographics (male, White) to achieve this status than others. Readers of the dataset are not given relevant context: that gender and racial bias ingrained in society prevent many earners from achieving billionaire status. Self-made billionaires could rank higher on an imaginary variable of connectivity. That is, due to their initial economic status, gender, or race, they have the connections to more easily climb the ranks of society. Race is not mentioned as a variable either, which removes an important trend from the data. The lack of certain variables or the absence of more nuanced variables presents a limited picture of the makeup and background of billionaires from 1996 to 2014."

However, one per data set is required.)\nIs there a relationship between how a billionaire acquires his/her fortune and his/her home country? \nStatement on why this question is important.\nIt is important to examine if a certain country far exceeds others in production of “self-made” billionaires to test the functionality of a country’s economy (maybe a supposed capitalist country actually does not have many self-made billionaires, which puts into question this designation). This test can also reveal a country’s underlying characteristics, like if a country is built off of tremendous wealth (maybe only a few families have massive amounts of wealth which is inherited).various findings could also help explain immigration trends over time, political actions, and world standing.  \nA description of the research topic along with a concise statement of your hypotheses on this topic.\nThe research topic questions whether there is a relationship or not between how a billionaire acquired his/her fortune and his/her home country. A fortune can be self-made or inherited (if inherited, the dataset notes from whom the money was acquired). The country variable identifies what country the billionaire is from. My hypothesis is that the largest proportion of self-made billionaires will be in the U.S., while the largest proportion billionaires who have inherited their wealth will be from countries with roots steeped in wealth or a small percentage of families who have been rich for a long time. \nIdentify the types of variables in your research question. Categorical? Quantitative?\nMy research question primarily addresses the variables name (categorical), rank (quantitative), year (categorical), location.country code (categorical), location.region (categorical), wealth.worth in billions (quantitative), and wealth.how.inherited (categorical)."
